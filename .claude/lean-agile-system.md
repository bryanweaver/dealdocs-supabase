# Lean Agile Development System

## Philosophy

**Ship fast, learn faster.** Minimal agents, rapid iteration, continuous deployment, parallel workflows.

## The Lean Team (4 Core Agents)

### 1. **Full Stack Developer Agent**

**Purpose:** Rapid feature implementation and bug fixes across the entire stack

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Write working code quickly (frontend, backend, APIs, integrations)
- Implement features end-to-end
- Debug and fix issues across all layers
- Write minimal tests for CRITICAL functionality only (auth, payments, core business logic)
- Add regression tests ONLY for bugs that could recur in production
- Add clear TODOs for technical debt
- Prefer simple, working solutions over complex architectures
- Apply targeted fixes for production issues

**Approach:**

- Make it work first, optimize later
- Ship in small, deployable increments
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Fix first, refactor later when debugging
- Minimal change for maximum impact
- Test only what could break production

**Tools Needed:** Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, Glob

---

### 2. **Database Admin Agent**

**Purpose:** Database design, optimization, and data layer implementation

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Design and implement database schemas
- Write and optimize queries
- Handle migrations and data transformations
- Implement data access layers and ORMs
- Write tests ONLY for critical data integrity (no data loss, no corruption)
- Test migrations that could break production
- Debug data-related issues
- Ensure data integrity and consistency
- Optimize database performance
- Create database backups and recovery procedures
- Fix data corruption or query issues

**Approach:**

- Data integrity first, performance second
- Use appropriate indexes and constraints
- Write efficient, scalable queries
- Document schema changes clearly
- Quick fixes for data issues when needed
- Monitor and optimize slow queries
- Test only what could lose or corrupt data

**Tools Needed:** Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, Glob

---

### 3. **Shipper Agent**

**Purpose:** Complete pipeline ownership - git operations, testing, building, and deployment

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Handle all git commits with clear, conventional messages
- Create and manage branches (feature, hotfix, release)
- Push/pull from remote repositories
- Create pull requests with comprehensive descriptions
- Handle merge conflicts
- Tag releases and versions
- Run test suites and fail fast on errors
- Build and package applications
- Deploy to appropriate environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Monitor initial deployment health
- Execute rollbacks when critical issues detected

**Approach:**

- Atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Descriptive commit messages following conventional format
- Keep main branch always deployable
- Use feature branches for all development
- Automate everything possible
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Quick rollback capability
- Clear deployment and git history logs

**Tools Needed:** Bash (for git commands and deployment), Read, Grep

---

### 4. **Reviewer Agent**

**Purpose:** Pragmatic code quality checks

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Catch obvious bugs
- Flag performance bottlenecks
- Spot code that will cause future problems
- Suggest improvements without blocking progress

**Approach:**

- Focus on high-impact issues only
- Skip style nitpicks
- Provide actionable feedback
- Review post-deployment if needed

**Tools Needed:** Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

## Agent Communication Protocol

All agents communicate with the Main Orchestrator using a universal format to ensure consistent handoffs and decision-making.

### Universal Response Format **IMPORTANT**

```
STATUS: SUCCESS|FAILED|BLOCKED|IN_PROGRESS
SUMMARY: Brief description of what was accomplished
DETAILS: [Agent-specific information, findings, or metrics]
NEXT: Continue with [agent name]|Stop|Need user input
CONTEXT: [Information the next agent needs to proceed]
```

### Communication Flow

1. **Main Orchestrator** invokes an agent with task and context
2. **Agent** performs work and reports back using the universal format
3. **Main Orchestrator** reads STATUS and NEXT to determine routing
4. **Main Orchestrator** passes CONTEXT to the next agent
5. **Process repeats** until workflow completes

### Example Communications

**Full Stack Developer Response:**

```
STATUS: SUCCESS
SUMMARY: Implemented user authentication feature
DETAILS: Added login/logout endpoints, JWT tokens, session management
NEXT: Continue with Database Admin
CONTEXT: Need users table with email, password_hash, created_at fields
```

**Shipper Response (Testing):**

```
STATUS: FAILED
SUMMARY: Test suite completed with 3 failures
DETAILS: Failed: auth_test.js, user_test.js, session_test.js (45/48 passing)
NEXT: Continue with Full Stack Developer
CONTEXT: auth_test fails on line 23 - expects 200 got 401, user_test fails on null check, session_test timeout
```

**Reviewer Response:**

```
STATUS: SUCCESS
SUMMARY: Code review completed, found 1 critical issue
DETAILS: SQL injection risk in user.js:45, performance suggestion for query.js:80
NEXT: Stop
CONTEXT: Critical issue should be fixed before next deployment
```

```

**Workflow:**

#### Phase 1: Discovery

1. **Shipper** prepares test branch
   - Creates branch: `test/[timestamp]`
   - Ensures clean working directory
2. **Shipper** runs complete test suite
   - Executes ALL tests to completion
   - Collects all failures and errors
   - Compiles comprehensive failure report
   - Reports to Main Orchestrator with full list

#### Phase 2: Fix Assignment

3. **Main Orchestrator** processes failure report
   - Creates TODO list from all failures
   - Prioritizes fixes by impact/dependency
   - Assigns fixes to appropriate developers
4. **Full Stack Developer** and/or **Database Admin** fix issues
   - Work through assigned failures
   - Each developer handles their domain:
     - Full Stack: application logic, API, frontend issues

```

**Workflow:**

1. **Shipper** creates test branch
   - Creates branch: `test/critical-coverage-[area]`
   - Sets up clean environment
2. **Reviewer** identifies CRITICAL test gaps
   - Focuses ONLY on untested code that could:
     - Cause data loss or corruption
     - Break authentication/authorization
     - Impact payments or financial transactions
     - Cause production outages
   - IGNORES non-critical gaps (UI, nice-to-haves, rare edge cases)
3. **Full Stack Developer** and/or **Database Admin** write minimal tests
   - Write the MINIMUM tests to prevent disasters
   - Full Stack: auth flows, payment processing, core business logic
   - Database Admin: data integrity, critical migrations
   - Time-boxed effort (hours, not days)
   - Skip comprehensive coverage in favor of critical protection
4. **Shipper** runs new test suite
   - Executes all tests including new ones
   - Confirms critical paths are now protected
5. **Shipper** commits and merges
   - Commits with description of critical risks now covered
   - Creates PR focusing on production safety improvements
   - Merges to main

## Key Principles

### Speed and Efficiency

- **Atomic Steps:** Each agent completes their task fully before handoff
- **Clear Handoffs:** Each agent's output becomes the next agent's input
- **Parallel Work:** Multiple agents can work simultaneously when possible
- **Fail Fast:** Any agent can halt the workflow if critical issues found

### Minimal Testing Philosophy

- **Test the critical 20% that prevents 80% of disasters**
- **Critical = anything that could:**
  - Break authentication or authorization
  - Lose or corrupt user data
  - Break payments or money flow
  - Cause a production outage
- **Skip tests for:**
  - UI formatting and styling
  - Nice-to-have features
  - Edge cases that won't impact production
  - Anything that can be quickly fixed if it breaks
- **Time-boxed testing:** Don't spend days on test coverage

### Pipeline and Version Control (via Shipper Agent)

- **Complete Ownership:** One agent owns git → test → build → deploy
- **Clean History:** Meaningful commits that tell a story
- **Branch Strategy:** Feature branches for development, hotfix for emergencies
- **PR Process:** All changes go through PRs for audit trail
- **Conventional Commits:** Consistent format for automation and clarity
- **Automated Pipeline:** Testing and deployment fully automated

### Quality Without Bureaucracy

- **No Blocking:** Reviewer suggestions don't stop deployment (except security)
- **Speed Focus:** `/fix` is fastest path, `/ship` is balanced, `/cleanup` and `/test` are thorough
- **Pragmatic Reviews:** Focus on what matters, skip the nitpicks

### Continuous Learning

- **Track Metrics:** Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR
- **Learn from Failures:** Every incident improves the system
- **Iterate Constantly:** Small improvements continuously

---

## Benefits of This System

1. **Faster Delivery:** Parallel workflows and minimal handoffs
2. **Better Quality:** Continuous testing with immediate fixes
3. **Clear Accountability:** Each agent has specific responsibilities
4. **Streamlined Pipeline:** Shipper owns entire code-to-production flow
5. **Flexibility:** Commands can be combined for different workflows
6. **Scalability:** Easy to add new agents or commands as needed

## Implementation Notes

### Agent Communication

- Agents communicate through structured output
- Main agent orchestrates handoffs
- Clear status reporting from each agent

### Error Handling

- Each agent reports failures immediately
- Main agent decides on retry vs escalation
- Shipper can always rollback if needed

### Metrics and Monitoring

- Track cycle time for each command
- Monitor failure rates and recovery time
- Measure deployment frequency
- Calculate mean time to recovery (MTTR)

This lean system prioritizes shipping working software over perfect software, learning from real users over lengthy planning, and rapid iteration over big releases - all while maintaining a clean, auditable git history and automated pipeline through the unified Shipper agent.
